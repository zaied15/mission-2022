          You engage your website visitors with a user-friendly design and in an
          interactive format and delight them with your product or service
          offerings beyond their expectations. Your business mission statement
          should do no less to your other stakeholders.Web design go beyond
          graphics, content and metrics. Development specialties could be in
          CMS, databases, SEO, SMM, eCommerce, Analytics and more, but one thing
          is common: the need for a well-crafted mission.
